## Data Types

The most common data types in Python that are of use to us are `int`, `float`, `str` and `bool`.

- **Integer**
  Integers are non decimal numbers in Python and are represented using `int` keyword.
- **Floating Point**
  Floating point numbers in Python are numbers with fractional parts. They are represented using `float` keyword.
- **String**
  Strings in Python are represented by alphanumeric set of characters and can be numbers, aplhabets or combination of both. They are represented using `str` keyword.
- **Boolean**
  Boolean values in Python are those which have only 2 values. In Python it is represented using `bool` keyword and contains `True` or `False` values.

```python
# Boolean data example
a = bool(1)
b = bool(0)
print(a)
print(b)
```

    True
    False
